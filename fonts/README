### Font Formats #

You might not want to use all these formats. Here's my motivation for keeping
these particular formats:

* I kept tff-files to have some sort of backwards compatibility.

* The woff format should be supported by modern browsers.
    - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format#Vendor_support

* Woff2 has got better compression and is supported by most modern browsers.
    - see https://caniuse.com/woff2

If you think any of these are useless just remove the ones you don't want to
use.

If you need other formats they can be found here:

If you feel that something is missing or that I'm clearly wrong about
something don't hesitate to make some changes and send me a pull request.

You might also want to take a look at the fonts.css file in the root
directory.

Note: I'm aware of Google Fonts and I'm not interested in using it.
