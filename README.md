# Kikofri

Kikofri is a theme for Jekyll that's a fork of the [Kiko theme](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) by [@gfjaru](https://twitter.com/gfjaru).

It came about because I like my themes like I like my music: ugly, old and barren. It's an assortment of hacks filtered through web-design choices from the turn of the millennium.

The theme doesn't use any Google Analytics spyware by default. If you necessarily need stuff like that consider using [piwik](https://github.com/piwik/piwik) instead. Kikofri doesn't rely on Google Fonts API for font rendering and the like. Some metadata for search engines is provided by [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag).

You'll see it undead here [https://kxxvii.github.io/Kikofri/](https://kxxvii.github.io/Kikofri/)

## To do:

* Clean up redundant markup
* Reevaluate the need for four layouts
* Listen to Good Friendly Violent Fun by Exodus

## How to:

1. Fork this repository and/or...
2. Clone the repository to your computer.<br />`git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/Kikofri`  
3. Run it.<br />`jekyll serve`
4. If that doesn't work you might want to take a look at the Gemfile in the cloned repository and satisfy dependencies where it is needed.
5. Go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser.

### General pointers:

* If you don't use Github remove the line `gh-pages` in the Gemfile in addition to consulting the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for [deployment options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/)
* The same goes for `jekyll-seo-tag` and `jekyll-paginate`. If you don't want to use pagination you should also make some changes to the index.html file
* For indented paragraphs type: `µµ`
* Tags can be sorted first under `/tags` by making the first letter an Upper-case one in the post's front matter
    - To sort something last make the first letter a lower-case one 
    - To just sort tags alphabetically use only upper- or lower-case letter consistently throughout posts
* Kikofri uses the [Ubuntu font](http://font.ubuntu.com/). If you wish to use another font change or remove these files/lines:
    - fonts/
    - fonts.css
    - \_layouts/default.html (look for: `<link href="/fonts.css"...`)  
    - \_layouts/default_post.html (look for: `<link href="/fonts.css"...`)
    - style.scss (look for: `font-family: 'Ubuntu'...`)

## Make it a little less ugly:

1. Change the name and modify nav at `_config.yml`.
2. Make some appropriate changes — or inappropriate if you're into those kind of things — in `about.md`.
3. Navigate to the `_posts` folder and remove the example content by writing `rm *` in your terminal (make sure that you're in the right folder)
 - while you're at it create a post of your own like so: `touch YYYY-MM-DD.md`
 - then do something like this: `echo -e "---\ntitle: 'Friends Don't Lie.'\ndescription: 'No more.'\nauthor: 'Eleven'\n---" > YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. Type away! Reject my reality and substitute your own!
